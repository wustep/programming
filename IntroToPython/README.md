# Intro to Python

This is a series of Jupyter notebook tutorials for Python 3!

## Installing Python

Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) is recommended, since it comes with most of thee dependencies we need, like Jupyter notebook! Alternatively, using python with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended for more advanced users.

We'll be using 3.7.2+, so be sure to use that.
