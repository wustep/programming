# Intro to Python

This is a series of Jupyter notebook tutorials for Python 3!

## Installing Python

Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) is recommended, since it comes with most of the dependencies we need, like Jupyter notebook. Alternatively, using python with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended for people with more experience.

We'll be using 3.7.2+, so be sure to download that.

To run a Jupyter notebook server, you can either run the `Jupyer Notebook` application, or use `jupyter notebook` in a terminal.
