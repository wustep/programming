    "\n",
    "For example, if my query was `height of \"Duane Washington Jr.\"`, the name-based dict is really quick, since we can just do `osu_team_roster_dict[\"Duane Washington Jr.\"][\"Height\"]` but the list version or list-of-OrderedDicts used above would require you to search up to the entire list till you found Duane.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time can be modeled as **time-complexity**, and in this case, it would be `O(n)` for searching the entire list for Duane, where `n = number of players on team`. This means it takes linear time based on the number of players on the team to solve this problem. For using the name-based dict, we have `O(1)` or constant time, since dicts have constant lookup time. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, we have a best-case-scenario of `O(1)` (found in the 1st element), an average-case of `O(n/2)` (half the elements) which simplifies to `O(n)` in this **big-O notation** and a WORST-CASE of `O(n)` (found in the last element). [Read more here](https://brilliant.org/wiki/big-o-notation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't an issue for our small roster of 13 players, but if we had 1,000,000, it would be a big improvement to use the name-based dict. However, the name-based dict takes more space. Space v. time complexity is a big topic, and discussing these trade-offs is a big part of Computer Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "`O(1) > O(log(n)) O(n) > O(n^2) > O(n!) > O(n^n)` -- these are some other common time/space-complexities. "
